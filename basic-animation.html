        <p>In the first task for "Basic Animation" Theme, we had to trigger animation with Java Script for the first time and link it to out HTML and CSS file. The simple animation requested a mere image that it animated by buttons which trigger certain animations and makes the image move.To enjoy the task more, I chose my boyfriend's bag brand. He had fun watching it after! </p>

        <p>The following week I learned how to make a more developed animation. I practised my skills more in Adobe Illustrator and I drew my first ever characters inspired by my friend's toy brand.Also, I was taught how to draw a spritesheet in order for my animation to move accros the screen in the positions that I wanted them to do and give them more personality and "life".</p>

        <p>The "Interactive Animation" task was a group work and it represents a known children story made by us into an animation which demands the involvement of the user in certain ways. In this project, we learned how to add sound to our animation and also developed ourselves within Adobe Illustrator when drawing the simple characters. </p>

        <p>ProjectPool Day 2 consisted of the same one day assignment but together with another classmate where we needed to create an animation based on an example given by the teacher. We needed to imagine how we can build up the specific animation in order to look more or less the same with the teachers' and to function properly. The challenging part was to build it with our JavaScript beginner knowledge.Me and my partner decided to make the "JavaScript Calculator".</p>

        <p>For this project, me and my group had 2 weeks time to complete a complex interactive animation based on any known children story and a given style.My group received the style called "Surrealism" and we did our best to incorporate our ideas and story into that style.
            <br> After doing a brainstorm, we decided to make "Alice in Wonderland" and step by step, we started to develop our animation first in paper and then working in the real programmes to make it "alive". Have a look at our story board here!
