    <p>The task above represents a group work as well and it is among my favorite ones since while doing it I had both fun and I learned a lot of things that developed me as a multimedia designer.For example we had classes about film making steps and we were presented technical information about sound, editing, how to tell a story properly, as we had communication lectures as well, coming from a film perspective.The main task, as the title suggests, was to tell a story without using words and our theme was "People who are too busy".It was the first time I worked in Adobe Premiere Pro and it was very interesting.

    <p class="storyboard-description">In the storyboard you can see the visualization of the video before the making. We tried to be as detailed as possible so we don't forget anything to shoot on the field. This step was very important since it helped us to stay focused on the main ideas even if we were free to improve them along the way!

    <p>The website is the final product of our group project called "Promoting an idea" where we had to explain the rules of biking in Copenhagen in a creative way together with a video that we edited. At first all of us were given the biking rules owned by "I bike Copenhagen" so we needed to imagine that we have a real client for which we need to promote the idea and message.
